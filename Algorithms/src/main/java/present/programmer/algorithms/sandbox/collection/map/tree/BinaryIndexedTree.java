 * Consider the following problem: There are n boxes that undergo the following queries:
 * 1. add marble to box i
 * 2. sum marbles from box k to box l
 * We have N elements and M queries.
 * This data structure allows to solve the problem with time complexity O(M log N) (alternatively, Red-Black BST could be used, but implementation of this is much simpler shorter).
