# JavaScript Basics sandbox

## Will need to add the following notes

### jQuery

* children() to target an element's child elements.
* siblings() to target elements adjacent to an element.
* parent() to target an element's parent.
* closest() travels up the DOM tree from the current element to target the closest element with a given selector.
* next() to target the element immediately following the selected element.
* prev() to target the element that is immediately preceding the selected element.
* find() to target descendant elements by some selector, ie- class, id, tag etc.
